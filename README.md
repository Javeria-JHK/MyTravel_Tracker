# MyTravel_Tracker
This project tracks the countries on the world map in which you have travelled. It uses Database containing two tables, countries table and visited_countries table.

Step 1: Add the CSV files into your Database ( I have done this using Postegres).
Step 2: change the Database configuration according to your database.
Step 3: Install all the modules. 
  "npm i"
Step 4: Run file index.js
